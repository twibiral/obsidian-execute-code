# Obsidian Execute Code Plugin

This plugin allows you to execute code snippets in code blocks in your notes. The plugin adds a 'run' button for code blocks in supported languages. Clicking them results in the code of the block being executed. After the execution the result of the execution is showed. An interactive input element is created when your code snippets reads expects user input.

The result is shown only after the execution is finished. It is not possible to enter text on the command line into the executed program now.

![Video that shows how the plugin works.](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code/blob/master/images/execute_code_example.gif?raw=true)


The following [languages are supported](#supported-programming-languages): C, CPP, Golang, Groovy, Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, CSharp, Prolog, Rust, Python, R, Wolfram Mathematica, Haskell, Scala, Shell & Powershell. 


Python and Rust support embedded plots. All languages support ["magic" commands](#magic-commands) that help you to access paths in obsidian or show images in your notes.

You can create code blocks that are executed before or after each code block of the same language and define [global code injections](#global-code-injection-and-reusing-code-blocks).

Take a look at the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed in recent versions.

```

- By default, Python runs in Notebook Mode. You can turn this off in the settings.
- Plots with matplotlib/seaborn are embedded in the note by default. You can turn this off in the settings.

Squiggle: For Squiggle support take a look at the [Obsidian Squiggle plugin](https://github.com/jqhoogland/obsidian-squiggle) by @jqhoogland.

Support for the following is planned:

- Matlab
- Julia Lang

Open for suggestions.

## Magic Commands

Magic commands are some meta commands that can be used in the code block. They are processed by the plugin before the source code is executed.

The following magic commands are supported:

- `@vault`: Inserts the vault path as string.
- `@note`: Inserts the note path as string.
- `@title`: Inserts the note title as string.
- `@show(ImagePath)`: Displays an image at the given path in the note.
- `@show(ImagePath, Width, Height)`: Displays an image at the given path in the note.
- `@show(ImagePath, Width, Height, Alignment[center|left|right])`: Displays an image at the given path in the note.
- `@html(HtmlSource)`: Displays HTML in the note

(`@show(...)` and `@html(...)` are only supported for JavaScript and Python yet.)

![Example how to use the magic commands.](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code/blob/master/images/magic_example.png?raw=true)

## Running in Preview

Adding `run-` before the language name in the code blocks (as in the example below) renders the code block in the preview already.
This allows you to execute the code in the preview.

``````
```run-python
def hello(name):
print("Hello", name)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello("Eve")
`````` 

## Code Block Arguments

Code blocks support specifying additional arguments in the form `{key='value', otherkey=['val1', 'val2']}`. Add them to code blocks like so:

`````
```python {label='my label'}
print('my labelled code block')
```
`````

## Global Code Injection and Reusing Code Blocks

Sometimes it is helpful to have code that is executed before or after each other block of the same language. This plugin supports this in a few ways:

### Global Injection in the Settings

All languages have a 'global inject' option in the settings that allows defining code to be added to the top of every single code block on a per-language basis. Code reuse fully works with all languages, and all existing magic commands, including showing images, and inline plot outputs. This can be used to define e.g. often used functions or import your favourite packages or libraries.

### Note-wide Pre- and Post-Code Blocks

You can specify the `pre` argument to create a block that is executed before each following code block:

``````
```python {pre}
import pandas as pd
```
``````

This code block is added before each python block you define below in the note and import the pandas package.

`post` blocks work the same way, but the code in post blocks is executed _after_ your other code blocks.

Pre/Post blocks will only apply to code blocks defined below them, and will only apply to code blocks from the same language.

You can also have a pre and post block at the same time by specifying `{pre, post}`

Note, the `pre`/`post` arguments are special in that you don't need to explicitly state a key/value pair, however you can do so if you wish:

`{pre}` is equivalent to `{export='pre'}`, `{pre, post}` is equivalent to `{export=['pre', 'post']}`.

### Labelled Code Blocks

You can label specific code blocks with the `label='string'` argument, then import them explicitly in other blocks with the `import='string'` or `import=['string1', 'string2', ...]` argument so they aren't automatically imported as with pre / post blocks:

`````
```python {label='block 1'}
print('running block 1')
```

```python {label='block 2'}
print('running block 2')
```

```python {import=['block 1', 'block 2']}
print('should run block 1 and 2')
```
`````

Labelled code blocks will be executed before the code block being run, however after global injects and pre blocks.

### Ignoring Code Exports

In case you want to manually ignore specific exports in a code block like pre / post / global exports, you can do so with the `ignore` argument that accepts either `pre`, `post`, `global`, an array of any of these 3, or `all` to ignore all exports:

`````
```python {ignore='all'}
print('should not run any global injects or pre / post blocks')
```

```python {ignore=['global', 'pre']}
print('should not run any pre blocks or global injects')
```
`````

### Notebook Mode

A few languages (currently JS and Python) support *Notebook Mode*. If a language is using Notebook Mode (configurable in Settings), then all code blocks in a given file will execute in the same environment.

Variables functions, etc. defined in one code block will be available in other code blocks. Code blocks are executed on demand; the order of code blocks in the file does not affect the order in which they are executed:

``````
```js
console.log(f)
```
```js
let f = 3;
```
``````

Running the first code block, then the second, then the first again will give:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: f is not defined
undefined
3
```

To manage the open runtimes for Notebook Mode, you can use the `Open Code Runtime Management` command in the command palette. From this sidebar window, you can stop kernels. **Note: force-stopping requires `taskkill` on Windows and `pkill` on Unix. 99% of systems should have these preinstalled: if yours doesn't, please [file an issue](https://github.com/twibiral/obsidian-execute-code/issues/new/choose)**


## Style Settings

This plugin supports customising styles using the [Style Settings plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). It's possible to customise the color of code block outputs and errors.

## Installation

In your vault go to Settings > Community plugins > Browse and search for "Execute Code". Select the plugin, install it and activate it.

or

Follow [this link](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=execute%20code#) and click "Open in Obsidian".

## Warning

Do not execute code from sources you don't know or code you don't understand. Executing code can cause irreparable damage.

## Known Problems

- On Linux, Snap/Flatpak/AppImage installations of Obsidian run in an isolated environment. As such, they will not have access to any of your installed programs. If you are on Linux, make sure to install the `.deb` version of Obsidian. If your distro isn't compatible with `.deb` files, you may see issues.
- Missing when `run` button after switching the theme: Try to close and reopen your notes and wait for a few minutes. It seems like obsidian doesn't call the postprocessors after the theme switch.
- Pre- / Post-blocks may not be executed if the file contains duplicate code blocks.
- In Python, Embed Plots may not be off while Notebook Mode is on

## Future Work

- Notebook Mode similar to Jupyter
- Error warning when the execution fails (e.g. when python isn't installed)
- Test if this plugin works in combination with dataview.
